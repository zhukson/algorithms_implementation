# Implementation from scratch: (in python)
  1. Perceptron: trained with 70 samples, reached 99.6% validation accuracy with 30 samples.
  2. NaiveBeyes: using Laplacian smoothing to avoid zero conditional probability.

# other project(final project from CSC546 intro to machinelearning)
stochastic grid search: tuning hyperparameters of randomforest by combining grid search and random search, that is, randomly sample hyperparameters from a grid in the hyperparameter space.
